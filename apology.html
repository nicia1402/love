    <h1>i am really sorry my baby..</h1>
    <p>
        i know the last few days have been really heavy for us. i’m truly sorry for the pain i caused and for the moments where i didn’t show up the way you deserved. losing you, even for that short time, made me realize just how important you are to me and how much you mean in my life. you’re not just someone i talk to every day, you’re the person who makes my days better, who makes me smile when i don’t even feel like smiling. the thought of not having you there hurt more than i can explain, and it made me understand that what we have is something i never want to take for granted again. i know words alone can’t fix everything, but i promise to try harder, to listen better, and to love you in a way that makes you feel safe and valued. thank you for giving us another chance, because having you in my life is something i cherish more than i’ve ever said out loud.
    </p>

    <p>
        i’ve been thinking a lot about the kind of man i want to be for you, and i know that loving you means more than just saying pretty words. it means changing the parts of me that hurt you, growing past my pride. you are the best thing that has happened to me, and you deserve a version of me that is patient, understanding, and consistent. i don’t want to be the reason you ever doubt your worth again. i want to be someone who reassures you, who communicates instead of shutting down, and who fights for us instead of letting distance or misunderstandings win. you are worth changing for, not because you asked me to, but because you inspire me to be better. being with you makes me want to level up in every way, emotionally and mentally. i promise to work on my flaws(ik i haev said that a lot f times but i will try my best to not let it be incomplete like the past promises), to listen more carefully to your feelings, and to show you through actions that you matter to me every single day. you are not just my girlfriend, you are my safe place, you are my wife., and i will do everything i can to protect what we have.
    </p>

    <p>
        i love you, and i value what we have.
        im committed to becoming a better partner, not just for you,
        but because it’s the right thing to do.
